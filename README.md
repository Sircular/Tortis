# Tortis
Tortis is a simple clone of Tetris written in C. It copies basic mechanics such as scoring, but modifies timing, difficulty levels etc. based on how well I play Tetris (i.e. not well.)

## Installation
There isn't an option to install it system-wide at the moment. To compile it, simply run `make`. Then you can run it by running `./tortis`.

## Known Issues
Rotation doesn't work like in the original Tetris games, so several strategies involving rotating a piece into place don't currently work. Quick drop is not implemented. Saving a block is not implemented.
